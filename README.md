# ITMD-525---Data-Mining
This project is aimed to train a prediction model to predict the click-through rate for advertisements based on features of the users. Nowadays, internet is full of different kind of advertisements through banners, ads in form of text, images, flash, video, and audio. Ads are used by companies to increase brand awareness, connect and engage with potential customers and hence it is important for the companies to know where to advertise and how successful the advertising is going on a platform. A prediction and recommendation system will be implemented to predict the click through rate of potential users and will suggest target users based on user preferences. Our prediction and recommendation system based on the click probability will make it possible for advertiser to know the probability of the user clicking the advertisement. Itâ€™ll support in deciding of putting the advertisement on the certain website so that advertisements only target at the users who might be interested in the ads, thus maximizing the profit of the advertisers and saving the excessive resource which is wasted on useless advertising. This project utilizes the various libraries available in Python to build the model.
